# Flyweight-C-
**What is the Flyweight pattern? **
Intrinsic state: Allows you to share unchanging data between objects 
Extrinsic state: Object-specific data can be passed in 
Shared objects act as a kind of accessible & unchanging model, which can be reused as much as needed 
Significantly cuts down on storage & memory usage 
It requires a specialised scenario to be effective: When a large number of objects needs to be created & most object state is categorised as extrinsic, flyweight can be very effective
